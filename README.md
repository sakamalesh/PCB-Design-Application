# Software required
Eagle

# Procedure
1.Open a new schematic file within your project.</br>
2.Use the libraries provided in EAGLE or create custom libraries if necessary.</br>
3.Place components onto the schematic sheet by using the 'Add' tool.</br>
4.Connect the components using the 'Net' tool.</br>
5.Label nets appropriately to ensure clarity</br>
6.Once routing is complete, perform a ERC to ensure there are no errors and save the schematic.</br>
7.Click on the 'Generate/Switch to Board' icon to create a board from your schematic.</br>
8.EAGLE's board layout editor allows you to place components, route traces, and define board shapes.</br>
9.Arrange components on the board to optimize space usage and minimize signal interference.</br>
10.Route traces to connect components according to your schematic.</br>
11.Use the various routing and editing tools provided by EAGLE to ensure proper routing and avoid design rule violations.</br>
12.Once routing is complete, perform a design rule check (DRC) to ensure there are no errors and save the board layout.</br>
13.Go to File > CAM Processor and set up CAM jobs to generate Gerber files for your PCB layers.</br>
14.Verify generated files to ensure they contain all necessary information.</br>
15.Save the generated manufacturing files.</br>
